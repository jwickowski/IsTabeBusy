.SYNOPSIS
Starts the build process. 


.DESCRIPTION
It imports PSCI library and packages projects according to the commands in the 'try' block. The packages will be stored at $PackagesPath.

.PARAMETER ProjectRootPath
Base directory of the project, relative to the directory where this script resides. It is used as a base directory for other directories.
  
.PARAMETER PSCILibraryPath
Base directory where PSCI library resides, relative to $ProjectRootPath.

.PARAMETER PackagesPath
Path to the directory where packages will be created, relative to $ProjectRootPath.

.PARAMETER DeployConfigurationPath
Path to the directory where configuration files reside, relative to $ProjectRootPath. By default '<script directory>\deploy'.

.PARAMETER Tasks
List of tasks (function names) to invoke for this build. If this is not specified, default task will be invoked (Build-All).

.PARAMETER Version
Version number of the current build.
